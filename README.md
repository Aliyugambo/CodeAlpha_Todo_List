 ## To-Do List ##

 A simple To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed

 ## How It Works: ##
 
 1. ## HTML: ##

    > A text input field for the user to add new tasks.
    > A button that adds the task to the list.
    > A <ul> (unordered list) element to display the list of tasks.

2. ### CSS: ##

    > Styled to make the interface clean and modern.
    > Each task (list item) has a delete button, and completed tasks have a strikethrough effect.

3. ### JavaScript: ###

> Captures input from the user, and on clicking the "Add Task" button (or pressing Enter), a new task is created.
> Users can click a task to mark it as complete (it will be crossed out).
> A delete button is attached to each task for removing tasks.
> The app keeps the interface simple by managing the tasks directly in the DOM without a database for now.
